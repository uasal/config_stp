## PSDs Folder

This area will be expanded in the future to include the PSD parameters with supporting code to generate the files.
For the moment, only a single set of PSDs has been generated to support ESC development.

### thermal_zernikes_case1.fits

40 hour time series of Zernikes 1 - 256 generated from a 2D spatiotemporal PSD created by Ewan Douglas using code found [here](https://github.com/uasal/wavefront_context_camera_designdocs/blob/main/sims/ZernikeEnvelope.ipynb).
Due to their size, and the fact they're only representative data to exercise the system,the PSDs themselves are (stored on box)[https://arizona.box.com/s/j50tuxv0fh285d7d9xkn0q998dvi94q7]
